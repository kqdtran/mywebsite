<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="2">I was born in Hochiminh City, Vietnam and lived there for the first 18 years of my life. Although&nbsp;I completed the&nbsp;entire K-12 education in my home country, I was fortunate enough to start learning English from 6th grade at </font><a href="http://www.trandainghia.net/" target="_blank" title="" style="font-size: small; ">Trandainghia High School for the Gifted</a><font size="2">.&nbsp;</font><br /><br /><font size="2">During my high school years, I was really uncertain about my future, and I couldn't&nbsp;decide what I would like to major in in college. Together with&nbsp;most of my peers, I jumped on the bandwagon and applied to a technical university (</font><a href="http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php" target="_blank" title="" style="font-size: small; ">University of Science HCM City</a><font size="2">), and a more business-oriented one (</font><a href="http://www.ftu.edu.vn/index.php/en/" target="_blank" title="" style="font-size: small; ">Foreign Trade University</a><font size="2">). Fortunately, I was admitted to both, but what really made my day was when my parents told me they were&nbsp;going to send me to the U.S. for my higher education and intellectual development.</font><br /><br /><font size="2">On September 4th, 2010,&nbsp;a whole new and exciting chapter in my life began as&nbsp;I set foot in the U.S., and started&nbsp;my first&nbsp;semester at <a href="http://www.mpc.edu/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" title="">Monterey Peninsula College</a>&nbsp;(MPC) only two days later.</font><br /><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 19px; "><br /></span><font size="2">In case you are wondering why I chose to go to a community college (CC) and not a four-year university, it was because&nbsp;I was downright lazy in high school. I didn't do thorough research on any particular university or major, nor did I take the SAT test, which is one of the most crucial admission requirements. On a less personal side, going to a CC really&nbsp;helped me and my family financially, while I still got&nbsp;to study a very similar curriculum to most universities in the first two years (at least in the breadth requirements). I didn't regret my decision to go to a community college at all because&nbsp;I got the chance to meet people from all walks of life, some of whom were simply amazing and inspirational.&nbsp;</font></div>

<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:50%;padding:0 15px'>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="2">During my short two years at MPC, I took various classes required for almost any technical majors, like Calculus, Physics, General Chemistry, and a set of breadth requirements. It was not until I took my very first class in Computer Science (<a href="http://tomrebold.com/csis10a/" target="_blank" title="">CSIS 10A</a>&nbsp;- Java)&nbsp;did I discover my passion and joy for programming. To be honest, I did learn programming in high school in Pascal because it was&nbsp;required for every student at my school. However,&nbsp;with all due respect, the experience sucked! The way they taught programming in high school for two whole years was just too different to even compare to what I learned in one college class.&nbsp;<br /><br />I then enrolled at another college to take an equivalent class to the aforementioned CSIS 10A to learn C++, while at the same time self-taught myself some Python and Javascript. My hard work eventually paid off when I found out that I was admitted to UC Berkeley as an international transfer student for the Fall 2012 Semester.&nbsp;<br /><br />I started much later than most people majoring in Computer Science, but my passion and dedication towards CS&nbsp;kept me moving forward. Lying ahead of me are another&nbsp;two years of adventure with&nbsp;new friends, engaging professors, and&nbsp;challenging coursework&nbsp;at the best public institution in the nation. I seriously cannot wait until this August to start a whole new adventure, and I am looking forward to all the crazy, mind-blowing stuff that CS, and Berkeley in general, will throw at me during the next two years.</font><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 19px; ">And as a Cal student, allow me to end my short (or maybe rather long) biography with two words:</span><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 19px; "><br /></span><br /><span style="line-height: 19px; "><font color="#000099"><font size="5"><strong>GO BEARS!</strong></font></font></span><br /><br /></div>
